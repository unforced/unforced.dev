# Unforced Development

A personal website for Aaron Gabriel's "Unforced Development" - helping builders, dreamers, and helpers share what they're here to give through a natural, empowering approach based on the philosophy of Wu-Wei (effortless action).

## About This Website

Unforced Development is Aaron Gabriel's mission to support creators in sharing their gifts with the world in a way that feels natural and empowering. This website serves as the digital heart of that mission, featuring:

- **The Jumpstart**: A unique 2-session process that creates a personalized website and toolkit for clients
- **Aaron's Story**: His journey blending Hakomi psychotherapy, ecopsychology, and creative technology
- **Service Offerings**: From the core Jumpstart process to ongoing 1:1 support sessions
- **Simple Booking**: Easy pathways to schedule free consultations or paid sessions

The site embodies Aaron's philosophy of Wu-Wei (effortless action) inspired by his father's Tai Chi practice, his Hakomi psychotherapy training, and his passion for balanced technology creation.

## Target Audience

The website is designed for:
- Entrepreneurs and small business owners who need to share their work online
